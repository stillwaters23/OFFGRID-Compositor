This is a running log. When any agent finishes or stops, it adds an entry here so Royalty and Claude can see where everyone left off.

Each entry has the date and time in America/Chicago, the agent number, the Bootloader step, what was done, the pull request or commit, the state, and the exact next thing to pick up.

States: passed, waiting for review, blocked, or waiting for Royalty's phone test.

## 2026-10-06 3:08 AM CT — Agent 01

- **Bootloader step:** Step 0. Project setup
- **What was done:** Built the Android app in `04 Build`. Kotlin, CameraX, and OpenGL ES. It shows a live front-camera preview. Agent 04 returned PASS. Royalty's phone test passed. The camera works.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #2, merged. Commit `c639731`.
- **State:** passed
- **Next:** Nothing left on Step 0. The next open step was Step 1 research.

## 2026-10-06 2:54 AM CT — Agent 02

- **Bootloader step:** Step 1. Outgoing video compositor, research part
- **What was done:** Wrote `02 Research/Outgoing Video Compositor Research.md`. Agent 04 returned PASS. The paper was merged. No code was built in that step.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #1, merged. Commit `3ca5e3c`.
- **State:** passed
- **Next:** The build part of Step 1, after Royalty says go. Agent 03 picked that up.

## 2026-10-06 3:12 AM CT — Agent 04 (Rex)

- **Bootloader step:** Not a build step. Rex voice training files.
- **What was done:** Rex voice training audio is being uploaded to `06 Prompts and Skills/Rex Voice/` (Rex 01.wav, Rex 02.wav, Rex 03.wav, plus Rex.md, the tagged script).
- **PR / commit:** On main. Latest voice commit `38d2c01`.
- **State:** The voice step is still paused.
- **Next:** Do not start Step 7. Wait until Royalty says go.

## 2026-10-06 3:29 AM CT — Agent 03

- **Bootloader step:** Step 1. Outgoing video compositor, build part
- **What was done:** Extended the Step 0 app in `04 Build`. One CameraX effect paints the camera, then an empty effect list, then a bright yellow diamond. The live view shows that painted picture. A Record 5 seconds button saves a short video on the phone with the mic off. Play last video plays it back. No stream library, no stream key, and no upload. Feature Scope now goes through feature 39 (read-aloud button, and speak as Rex). Both wait for the paused voice step. The Bootloader now says to write this log when an agent finishes or stops.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #3, not merged. Commit `7e6604b`.
- **State:** Waiting for Royalty's phone test
- **Next:** Rex (Agent 04) reviews pull request #3 and does not merge it. Royalty installs the step-1-preview build, taps Record 5 seconds, taps Play last video, and checks that the yellow diamond is in the video. Do not start Step 2 or Step 7.
