## 2026-10-06 3:08 AM CT — Agent 01

- **Bootloader step:** Step 0. Project setup
- **What was done:** Built the Android app in `04 Build`. Kotlin, CameraX, and OpenGL ES. It shows a live front-camera preview. Agent 04 returned PASS. Royalty's phone test passed. The camera works.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #2, merged. Commit `c639731`.
- **State:** passed
- **Next:** Nothing left on Step 0. The next open step was Step 1 research.

## 2026-10-06 2:54 AM CT — Agent 02

- **Bootloader step:** Step 1. Outgoing video compositor, research part
- **What was done:** Wrote `02 Research/Outgoing Video Compositor Research.md`. Agent 04 returned PASS. The paper was merged. No code was built in that step.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #1, merged. Commit `3ca5e3c`.
- **State:** passed
- **Next:** The build part of Step 1, after Royalty says go. Agent 03 picked that up.

## 2026-10-06 3:12 AM CT — Agent 04 (Rex)

- **Bootloader step:** Not a build step. Rex voice training files.
- **What was done:** Rex voice training audio is being uploaded to `06 Prompts and Skills/Rex Voice/` (Rex 01.wav, Rex 02.wav, Rex 03.wav, plus Rex.md, the tagged script).
- **PR / commit:** On main. Latest voice commit `38d2c01`.
- **State:** The voice step is still paused.
- **Next:** Do not start Step 7. Wait until Royalty says go.

## 2026-10-06 3:29 AM CT — Agent 03

- **Bootloader step:** Step 1. Outgoing video compositor, build part
- **What was done:** Extended the Step 0 app in `04 Build`. One CameraX effect paints the camera, then an empty effect list, then a bright yellow diamond. The live view shows that painted picture. A Record 5 seconds button saves a short video on the phone with the mic off. Play last video plays it back. No stream library, no stream key, and no upload. Feature Scope now goes through feature 39 (read-aloud button, and speak as Rex). Both wait for the paused voice step. The Bootloader now says to write this log when an agent finishes or stops.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #3, not merged. Commit `7e6604b`.
- **State:** Waiting for Royalty's phone test
- **Next:** Rex (Agent 04) reviews pull request #3 and does not merge it. Royalty installs the step-1-preview build, taps Record 5 seconds, taps Play last video, and checks that the yellow diamond is in the video. Do not start Step 2 or Step 7.

## 2026-10-06 4:32 AM CT — Claude Code (Step 2 build lane, lane number not given)

## 2026-10-06 4:32 AM CT — Claude Code (Step 2 build lane, lane number not given)

- **Bootloader step:** Step 1. Outgoing video compositor, build part

## 2026-10-06 4:37 AM CT — Claude Code (Step 2 build lane, lane number not given)

- **Bootloader step:** Step 2. Terminal panel and controls (Build)
- **What was done:** Built the floating terminal panel on top of the Step 1 app in `04 Build`. It is dark glass with cyan and gold glow lines. Drag the top bar to move it, or shrink it to a small tag. A side list and a grid of glowing folders show how many items are inside: Panel settings, OFFGRID to OFFGRID, and the 18 platform folders. Each platform folder holds an empty Effects folder and a Tests folder with 4 private test toggles. Each platform folder shows the guidance lines and the RESULTS line, filled from 02 Research or marked UNCONFIRMED. Text is laser typed in plain words. Opacity, Glow, and Typing speed are typed numbers from 0 to 100. Every toggle uses the red and green art from 03 Design/References. No sliders. The compositor and the yellow diamond test are unchanged. No mic and no voice. GitHub built the app and published it as step-2-preview.
- **PR / commit:** Pull request #4, not merged. Commit `259933a`.
- **State:** waiting for review
- **Next:** Rex (Agent 04) reviews pull request #4 and does not merge it. Then Royalty installs step-2-preview on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Galaxy A37 and runs the test steps in pull request #4, including the yellow diamond video check. Do not start Step 3 or Step 7.
